## 2. Environment Requirements
To integrate your environment with our system, ensure the following:

- **Gymnasium API Compliance:** Implement the standard Gymnasium methods `reset()` and `step(action)`.  
- **Consistent Agent Indexing:** Ensure agent indices remain consistent across observations, actions, and data structures for multi-agent environments.  
- **Handling Missing Data:** Fill positions with `None` in observations, rewards, etc., for agents without data (e.g., inactive agents).  
- **Autoreset Capability:** Implement automatic resets after episode termination, following Gymnasium conventions.  
- **Data Serialization:** Ensure all data exchanged is serializable to JSON format for HTTP communication.  

---

## 3. Integration Guidelines

### 3.1 Implementing Gymnasium-Compatible Methods
Implement the following Gymnasium methods:

#### `reset(seed=None, options=None)`
- **Purpose:** Resets the environment to an initial state.  
- **Returns:**  
  - `observation`: Initial observation(s).  
  - `info`: Dictionary for additional information (can be empty).  

#### `step(action)`
- **Purpose:** Advances the environment by one time step using the provided action.  
- **Returns:**  
  - `observation`: Observation(s) after the action.  
  - `reward`: Reward(s) obtained.  
  - `terminated`: Boolean(s) indicating episode termination.  
  - `truncated`: Boolean(s) indicating if the episode was truncated.  
  - `info`: Dictionary for additional information.

---

### 3.2 Handling Missing Observations
- Use `None` for agents with missing observations.  
- Maintain consistent array sizes across agents.  

### 3.3 Handling Final Observations
At the end of an episode, if your environment provides a final observation:

- **Gymnasium 1.0 Standards:**  
  - The environment should automatically reset after an episode ends.
  - The next `observation` returned will be the initial observation of the new episode.
  - `final_observation` in the `info` dictionary has been **deprecated**.
  - 
- **Pre-Gymnasium 1.0 Standards:**  
  - If the environment does not reset immediately, include a `final_observation` field in the `info` dictionary.
  - This field should contain the last observation(s) before the reset.  

Our system supports both behaviors and handles `final_observation` if provided.

---

### 3.4 Autoreset Behavior
Autoreset ensures that environments are ready for the next step without manual intervention:

- **Automatic Reset:**  
  - Automatically reset the environment after an episode ends (when `terminated` or `truncated` is `True`).
  - This avoids delays and ensures seamless episode transitions.

- **Observation After Reset:**  
  - The observation returned after reset must be the initial observation of the new episode.

- **No Missing Data:**  
  - Ensure that there is no delay or gap in the observation data during the reset process.

---

### 3.5 Multiple Observations at Episode End
In rare cases, environments may produce multiple observations at the end of an episode:

- **Provide the Latest Observation:**  
  - Always return the most recent observation along with the corresponding reward and flags.

- **Consistency:**  
  - Ensure that observation arrays remain consistent in size and agent indexing.

- **Clarify in `info`:**  
  - If the behavior is unusual, include additional details in the `info` dictionary to help interpret the output.

---

## 4. Communication Protocol

### 4.1 Data Serialization
To facilitate seamless communication, all data exchanged between your environment and our system must follow these guidelines:

- **Format:** Use JSON for data serialization.  
- **NumPy Arrays:** Convert NumPy arrays to Python lists before serialization.  
- **Preserve `None`:** Ensure that `None` values are retained to indicate missing or inactive data.  

---

### 4.2 API Endpoints
Our system interacts with your environment using the following HTTP endpoints:

| **Endpoint**       | **Purpose**                                 |  
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| `/make`            | Initialize a new environment instance.      |  
| `/make_vec`        | Initialize a vectorized environment.        |  
| `/reset`           | Reset the environment to its initial state. |  
| `/step`            | Advance the environment by one time step.   |  
| `/action_space`    | Retrieve the action space specifications.   |  
| `/observation_space` | Retrieve observation space specifications. |  
| `/close`           | Close the environment instance.             |  

---
### 4.3 Server Connection Setup 
**Base URL**

The server communicates through HTTP endpoints. Use the following base URL to interact with the Remote Gymnasium system: 
```
Base URL: https://your-api-domain.com
```
**Authentication**

To access the API, use an API key for authentication. Include the API key in the request headers:

```json
{
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```
Obtain your API key by contacting the system administrator.

---
### 4.4 Server Connection Workflow
**Initialize Environment** 

Send a `POST` request to `/make` or `/make_vec` to initialize a new environment instance. 

```json
POST https://your-api-domain.com/make
{
    "env_name": "CartPole-v1",
    "seed": 42
}
```

**Reset Environment**

Send a `POST` request to `/reset` to reset the environment to its initial state.

```json
POST https://your-api-domain.com/reset
```

**Take Steps in the Environment**

Send a `POST` request to `/step` with the action to execute.

```json
POST https://your-api-domain.com/step
{
    "action": 0
}
```
**Retrieve Metadata** 

Use `/action_space` and `/observation_space` endpoints to get the specifications of the action and observation spaces.
