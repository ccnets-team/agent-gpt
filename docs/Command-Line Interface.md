CLI commands are essentially the building blocks of your application's command line interfaceâ€”they're the actions a user can invoke from the terminal. In our AgentGPT CLI, for example, we've defined several commands:

- **config**:  
  Updates configuration settings. It accepts extra options (like `--batch_size`, etc.), merges them with the default configuration, and saves the result. This lets users dynamically modify how the application behaves.

- **list**:  
  Lists the full effective configuration (i.e., the defaults merged with any overrides). This is useful for verifying what settings are currently active.

- **clear**:  
  Deletes the configuration cache and terminates any running local simulation processes. This is a cleanup command that resets the state of the CLI.

- **simulate**:  
  Launches simulation environments. It supports different modes (e.g., local simulation by providing `--ip` and `--port`, tunnel simulation with `--tunnel`, or endpoint simulation with `--endpoint`). The command updates the configuration with the environment host details and, for local simulation, actually launches the environment.

- **train**:  
  Initiates a training job on SageMaker. It loads configuration settings (like hyperparameters) and submits a training job.

- **infer**:  
  Deploys or reuses a SageMaker inference endpoint using the stored configuration settings.

Each command is defined using a decorator (like `@app.command()`) from a CLI framework such as Typer. These decorators make the functions accessible from the terminal, automatically generating help messages and handling command-line parsing.

In summary, CLI commands let users interact with your application in a structured way by specifying what action to perform and supplying any necessary options or arguments.
